# Product List Display

## Description

This React application displays a static list of products. Each product is presented in a card format, showing the product's name, description, and price.

## Layout and Styling

The layout is straightforward, aiming for clarity and readability:
- Each product card has a slight border and padding to separate the items visually.
- The products are listed vertically with ample space between them to avoid clutter.

## Running the Application

To view the product list:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the application.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
